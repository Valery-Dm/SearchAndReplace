mainHelp: Program usage:\n\
                        Escape back slash \\ characters with another one - like so \\\\.\n\
                        Put phrases with space characters or if they start with dash character in double quotes "-like this one" to be correctly recognized.\n\n\
          Main Commands:\n\
                        {0}: show help,\n{1}: exit program,\n{2}: skip preview.\n\n\
             Parameters:\n\
                        -up [name of existing profile to use] -p [path to file or folder (required)] -f [what to find in it (required)] -r [what to put in its place] -x [what to exclude] -fn [modify also file names (yes or no)] -sf [include subfolders in search (yes or no)] -np [naming pattern (file''s path that will be included in search)] -cs [name of charset to use in read and write operations] -sp [name for profile to save under (can be empty, see details below)]\n\
                        At least two parameters are required: -p [path to file or folder] -f [what to find in it], these parameters may also be included in a profile, so it is OK to specify just a profile with them.\n\n\
            Key details:\n\
                        {0}: Shows this info. This key is expected to be alone on command line.\n\
                        {1}: Quits the program. This key is expected to be alone on command line.\n\
                        {2}: If you are certain about results, you may skip preview part, just put this key at the very beginning of command line. This is a special case and this key cannot be saved in a profile as a parameter.\n\
                        {3} (Required parameter): Specify a path to file or folder where to do search and replace. Expected to be a real path to the existing resource.\n\
                        {4} (Required parameter): Specify a phrase that needed to be found in the resource, it must be at least one character long. Required parameter.\n\
                        {5}: Specify a phrase that needed to be placed instead of found one. It is empty by default, so, if you won''t provide this setting then all found phrases will be just removed. Or you may intentionally specify it as empty if you need to overwrite profile setting.\n\
                        {6}: Specify what need not be replaced, an exclusion that have to has [what to find] phrase as a part of it. You can specify several exclusions after corresponding keys. Again, you may write just the key with the empty space after it if you want to overwrite profile setting (i.e. remove exclusions given in a profile).\n\
                        {7}: Use word: ({8}) to specify if you want to change also file names with the same rule as for their content. It is false by default, but you may type ({9}) if you need to overwrite profile setting.\n\
                        {10}: Use word: ({8}) to specify if you want subfolders to be scanned through. It is false by default, but you may type {9} if you need to overwrite profile setting.\n\
                        {11}: Specify what paths will be included in search and replace operation. See java.nio.file.FileSystems#getPathMatcher method description to find out what kind of patterns are supported by this program. Specify just one pattern per key, there can be several keys in command.\n\
                        {12}: You can specify a Charset name that will be used for reading and writing file contents. The default setting is {13}.\n\
                        {14}: Specify a name of existing profile with or without the file''s extension. If you will also specify other keys after it those keys parameters will overwrite corresponding settings of a profile. Any key given before this one will be overwritten by a corresponding profile''s setting. Usually, this key is provided alone at command line or as a first one, followed by specific keys.\n\
                        {15}: Specify a name under which current keys will be saved as a profile. This command expected at the very end of command line. Any parameters appeared after it won''t be saved in a profile (it''s may be your intention though). File''s extension will be added automatically. If this key has empty space following it and there is a profile specified in a command then that profile will be overwritten. If no profile used in a command and still no name provided then new profile will be saved with auto-generated name. If given name is the same as some existing profile has (not specified in a command) then you''ll be asked whether overwrite existing file or provide a new name.\n
